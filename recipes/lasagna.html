        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>6 cups of prepared marinara sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 pounds of ricotta</li>
            <li>8 ounces of fresh mozzarella, diced</li>
            <li>2/3 cups of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>1 pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>16 ounces of lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown sausage and ground beef in a medium stockpot on low, 
                breaking up meat as you go. Meat is cooked when brown and crumbly.
                Stir in mushrooms, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and italian seasoning.
                Cook on medium heat until mushrooms have released all their liquid and the 
                bottom of the pan is completely dry.</li>

            <li>Add prepared marinara to meat mixture. Turn heat to low and simmer until
                meat is extremely tender, about 2 hours. If the sauce becomes too thick,
                add water until it is the desired thickness. Skim excess fat from the top of 
                sauce, then taste and adjust seasonings.</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, beat eggs and add 2/3 cups of Parmigiano-Reggiano 
                cheese, mozarella cheese, and ricotta cheese. Season mixture with 
                salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add chopped parsley.
            </li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles
                and cook until soft but firm to bite. Drain and rinse noodles, set
                aside in a large bowl of cold water.
            </li>

            <li>Spread 1/4th of sauce into the bottom of a 10x15 inch baking pan.
                Top with 1/3rd of the noodles, and then spread 1/2 of cheese mixture
                on top. Spread 1/4th of sauce over the cheese, lay 1/3rd of the noodles
                on top of the sauce, then spread the remainder of the cheese mixture.
                Spread 1/4th of the sauce over the cheese, then carefully tap the bottom 
                of the pan on a surface to settle the layers. Now top the dish with the 
                remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano and mozzarella.
            </li>

            <li>Cover casserole with aluminum foil, being careful to not touch the
                top with the foil. Place in the oven on a sheet tray to catch spills.
            </li>

            <li>Cook in preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove foil and cook until 
                golden brown and bubbling (about 20-30 minutes). Make sure to let the 
                dish rest for at least 30 minutes or it will fall apart on the plate.
            </li>

            <li>Enjoy with loved ones!</li>
